These shacl files are taken from the [original DCAT-AP-EU site](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/rdf_entity/http_e_f_fdata_ceuropa_ceu_fw21_f016d88c3_ba0b3_b4506_bae4e_b758e7401c096).

The source location is at [github/SEMICeu/dcat-ap-shacl](https://github.com/SEMICeu/dcat-ap_shacl/tree/master/shacl-latest).

These files are only used as source documentation and not used to (re)create our own version of the SHACL specification.

The main reason is that the original SHACL files don't contain all information with regard to the specifications.
